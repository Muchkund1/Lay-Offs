We have a CSV dataset containing information about layoffs conducted by various companies. Our process involves data cleaning to ensure the data is accurate, consistent, and usable. After cleaning the data, we proceed with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends, patterns, and insights related to layoffs.
